# Git-GSoC-2026
I created a long-term open-source project to help me get ready for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) .
It will contain complete design, implementations, testing procedures and contribution guidelines built on this repository.
It will evolve over a period of next few months as a result of community input, iterative development and methods.

🚀 Goals
1.Create a well-tested,clean and modular codebase.
2.Review common open-source development cycles (issues, PRs, reviews, CI).
3.Create documentation for all architectural and design decisions made.
4.Identify key features that real contributors will benefit from.
