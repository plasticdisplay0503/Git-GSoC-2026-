# Git-GSoC-2026-
I created a long-term open-source project to help me get ready for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) .It will contain complete design, implementations, testing procedures and contribution guidelines built on this repository. It will change over a period of next few months as a result of community input, iterative development and methods.
