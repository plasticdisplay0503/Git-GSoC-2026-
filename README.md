# Git-GSoC-2026

I created a long-term open-source project to help me get ready for Google Summer of Code (GSoC).  
It will contain complete design, implementations, testing procedures, and contribution guidelines.  
It will evolve over the coming months through community input and iterative development.

---

## 🚀 Goals
1. Create a well-tested, clean, and modular codebase.  
2. Review common open-source development workflows (issues, PRs, reviews, CI).  
3. Document all architectural and design decisions.  
4. Identify and develop features that real contributors will benefit from.
